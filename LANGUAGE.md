# Y-talk conlang

## 1. Main concepts

The goals of the constructed language described in the following are:

- simplicity in the vocabulary
- complexity in what you can express
- integration with other languages

The language uses the basic 26 letter english alphabet but with consistent and in some cases wildly different pronounciation.
Every word consists of a single vowel and a single consonant, or a combination of two or more words.

Vowels are used to group words into a rough category, words starting with

- a are special words
- e are verbs
- i are pronouns and other miscellanious
- o are nouns
- u are adjectives

The consonants are used to specify the exact meaning.
Any group can be transmuted to another by simply prepending the group vowel before it.

The verb "em" - "to invite" can be turned into "oem" - "invitation".

Pronounciation is as follows:
